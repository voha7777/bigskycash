I want to create a html, css, javascript project, staticlly generated, it is a service based website, for a company that offer these services <services>, the website should be in US English. The website for this project is - https://bigskycash.org

Use the images from internet in an intelligent way to build a modern`website with good coloring schemes and fonts and other elements which I will leave up to your discretion to plan and then implement a good, intelligent color and font and feel to it

Please keep in mind that later i need to convert this site to static site usin ASTRO DIST FOLDER. WI WILL DO IT LATER WHEN I ASK YOU. NOT NOW.

Use <service_information> to understand specifics of the business

ensure to implement the SEO and keywords. meta titles and meta descriptions

The company is offering these services in <locations>

The idea is to generate all possible pages, combining both <services> with <locations> to create location based Mortgage Loans services.

For service + location pages try your best to create a modular (you can use svg icons to make this work) set up, with at least 5-7 different vertical unique blocks that add to the overall value of the page - this is important, because these are the pages we are truly trying to rank, and if they don’t have enough good unique information on them, they won’t rank. Ensure they are as varied as possible by using templates.

Ensure the pages are split by service, so no two service landing page should look the same (even if the service + location page do look the same)

Make sure the colors are contrasting and not white on white or black on black at any point

The content of those pages should be landing pages for the service itself, created from a template that you have built, using the images, and the other information you know or can interpret from what you’ve been given.

Have a good looking contact us page with the <contact_details> on it

Ensure to create a phenomenal modern homepage for the website using the images and information about services to make a modular, mobilefriendly (it must not scroll horizontally on mobile) homepage

Create icons and svgs as you’re going - start with something simple
Do not use src directory
Implement ISR so the website can be built again quickly and easily
Use NextJS, and tailwind to make a unique beautiful modern modular website with 5-7 unique vertical blocks per page (more on the homepage)

Be very careful and wary of typescript errors
Make sure you are generatingStaticParams - and not confusing dynamic generation and static generation,
Maximise build efficiency, speed, and complexity and modular nature of any pages which are generated for  SEO
Ensure to implement all slugs etc programmatically, and never create an index page link without creating the index page itself

You must be as detailed as possible with your SEO, abusing the fact that Google is very likely to rank pages that have exact phrase matches to keywords.
